        <p>"Hackathon", the technological event organized by Landmark for the first time in Albania. <br>
          Interesting terms that have conquered the world of technology, seem to be back in trend within 
          a very short time. The year 2020 served us the new "hackathon" trend, which was immediately 
          embraced by all.</p><br>

          <p>Landmark is always coherent, so it presented a completely innovative technological event, 
            which took place in the form of a competition, where talented young people and passionate 
            about technology, brought fantastic ideas and visionary products, realized in a relatively 
            short time.</p><br>

        <p>"Hackathon" came as a continuation of the first technological conference in Albania, "Think 
          Tech", which took place in February 2020 and was very successful, as it focused on the 
          development of young people, their careers in Albania and the opportunities that partners 
          provide them. Participants became more familiar with partner initiatives, success stories, as 
          well as training and professional advice that help professional growth and contribute best to 
          the local market.</p><br>

        <p>This time, "Think Tech Hackathon" brought another innovation, a very interesting topic such as
           "Internet of Things" (IoT). This topic consists of the fact that all devices that exist in the
            world and are in our function, can be connected to the Internet.</p><br>

        <p>Full 7 teams composed of experts in various technological fields, challenged each other, 
            implementing their brilliant ideas, under the pressure of time. As in any strong competition,
             only one managed to triumph and be awarded the first prize of 1,000 euros.</p><br>

        <p>TAt Landmark it has always been and will continue to be a tradition that every talented 
            young person is valued as a very important asset and is constantly motivated, being rewarded 
            for his contribution.</p><br>

        <p>The idea that managed to win the sympathy of the jury, was "Smart Bin for the City", an 
          original and useful way, which aims to perform proper waste management, in order to save time 
          and resources. The result would be a cleaner environment for us and for future generations, in 
          a much busier time.</p><br>

        <p>The jury consisted of Mrs. Juliana Lula, CTO and "Moveo Albania Technology", Mrs. Najada 
          Mehmeti, Senior Java Developer at "Sisal Albania" and Mrs. Ana Dëmbbi, Senior Software Developer
           at Landmark Technologies. The event also had special guests, Mr. Mario Martinelli, CIO and Sisal
            Group, Mr. Thimoty Barbieri, Enterprise Architect Manager in "Sisal Group" and in the hall, 
            respecting all security measures, present were Mrs. Alba Hoxha, Business Development in the B2B 
            ICT department at "ONE Telecommunications" and Mr. Gjergji Spaho, CIO of "Balfin Group". During 
            the event, the jury and guests shared with the audience their experiences and discussed more 
            about the importance and impact of "Internet of Things", noting the challenges that developers 
            are facing in this period.</p><br>
        <p>This event had very important partners such as: "Sisal Albania Hub", "One Telecommunications",
           "Moveo Albania Technology", "Balfin Group" and "Landmark", as the creator 
           and creator of Hackathon.</p><br>
           
        <p>Thanks to their cooperation and dedication, an extraordinary success was 
          achieved once again.</p><br>

          <p>For the first time, Landmark Communications and Technologies introduced a
            conference which focuses entirely on technology as the field of the future.
            We have tried to bring an activity different from events or conferences that
            address the same topic, serving new areas and opportunities in the field of technology.</p>
